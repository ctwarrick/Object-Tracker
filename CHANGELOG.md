# Change Log
## 0.3.0
Added the ability to long tap the map, which will spawn the street address or locality of 
the point the hand ray cursor is located at.
## 0.2.0
Added "Go To" button which takes a text input, queries Bing Maps API to see if it is a valid
location, and zooms map to the location if valid.  Known issue:  The fade effect on UI text
does not work as desired, but does not impair the "Go To" functionality.
## 0.1.0
Initial commit, minimum viable product for demo.
